You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

How much money can you make (or lose) by timing the market compared to time in the market? Wall Street Casino offers a platform where users can bet on live stock market movements using virtual currency. Users can view real-time market performance, chat with others, and size their bets. For each stock, users can enter a chat room with a 1 minute line chart of the selected security and view the betting status of other members. Their total winnnings and losses are reflected in the app leaderboard.

This sequence diagram demonstrates how a bet is placed and broadcasted to the chat room then updated on the leaderboard. It also shows how a chat message is broadcasted.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Correct HTML usage to create 5 pages:
    - For login,
    - For viewing personal portfolios,
    - For browsing through stocks,
    - For viewing the stock line chart and chat room (stock chart on top half, chat on bottom)
    - For purchasing and selling bets (modal)
- **CSS** - Consistent formatting, modularization of CSS elements, and readable styling will produce a simple yet clean and intuitive layout.
- **React** - Login form, viewing current portfolio, browsing and selecting a stock, rendering stock line chart and chat room, rendering bet purchase/sell modal, viewing leaderboard
- **Service** - Endpoints include:
    - Login authentication
    - Portfolio retrieval
    - Purchasing bets
    - Selling bets
    - Viewing live bet status
    - Stock data retrieval
    - Chat and chat messages 
- **DB/Login** - Register and login users; store bets; store leaderboard data
- **WebSocket** - Enable live chat, leaderboard rankings, and market data + bet valuations (using an API such as Polygon.io)
